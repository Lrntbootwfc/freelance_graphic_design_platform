# Freelance Graphic Design Platform - Smart Contract

## Project Title
Freelance Graphic Design Platform

## Project Description
This smart contract creates a decentralized platform connecting graphic designers with clients. It facilitates the creation, assignment, and completion of design projects on the Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts.

## Project Vision
To create a transparent, trustless platform where:
- Clients can post design projects with clear requirements and budgets
- Designers can discover and accept projects that match their skills
- All transactions and agreements are recorded immutably on the blockchain
- Payments can be securely escrowed and released upon project completion

## Key Features
1. **Project Creation**: Clients can create new design projects with title, description, and budget
2. **Project Assignment**: Designers can browse and accept open projects
3. **Project Completion**: Clients can mark projects as completed when satisfied
4. **Transparent Tracking**: All project status changes are recorded on-chain
5. **Permissionless Access**: Anyone can join as either client or designer

## Future Scope
1. **Escrow Payments**: Integrate with Stellar's payment system to hold funds in escrow
2. **Reputation System**: Implement a rating system for both clients and designers
3. **Dispute Resolution**: Add arbitration mechanisms for contested projects
4. **Project Categories**: Allow categorization of projects by design type (logo, web, etc.)
5. **Milestone Payments**: Support for breaking projects into phases with partial payments
6. **NFT Delivery**: Option to deliver final designs as NFTs with proper licensing
